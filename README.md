# gravity-spam-check
Blocks Gravity Forms submissions if they contain any keywords from WordPress' built-in "Disallowed Comment Keys" field. This plugin can be used in conjunction with the plugin "[Block List Updater](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blacklist-updater/)" to make word list management effortless.

This plugin provides *some* similiar functionality (but not all) to the commercial plugin "[Gravity Forms Blocklist](https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-blocklist/)" by GravityWiz.

If you are wanting to block email addresses (eg: *@country.ru) from Gravity Forms you should look at the free plugin ["Gravity Forms Email Blacklist"](https://github.com/crosspeaksoftware/gravity-forms-email-blacklist)
